# HelixLang Runtime Environment and Execution Model

## Overview

The HelixLang runtime is the core system responsible for executing HelixLang programs. It manages memory, variable scopes, data structures, biological simulations, and integrates with extensions or plugins. This document explains the runtime architecture, execution flow, supported data types, and performance considerations to help developers understand how HelixLang code runs from source to biological simulation.

## 1. Runtime Components

### 1.1. Memory Management

- HelixLang uses a managed memory model to handle both primitive and complex biological data types.
- Memory allocation is automatic for variables, sequences, and objects.
- Reference counting and garbage collection are employed to free unused objects and avoid memory leaks.
- Special care is taken for large biological sequences (DNA, RNA, protein) to optimize memory footprint.

### 1.2. Environment Scopes and Symbol Tables

- The runtime maintains **environments** representing variable scopes:
  - Global environment for top-level variables and functions.
  - Local environments created during function calls and block execution.
- Each environment uses a **symbol table** mapping identifiers to values or functions.
- Nested environments support lexical scoping and closures.
- Variable shadowing follows standard scoping rules.

### 1.3. Error Handling

- Syntax errors are detected before runtime (compile-time or parse-time).
- Runtime errors include:
  - Invalid biological operations (e.g., invalid nucleotide in sequence).
  - Type mismatches.
  - Out-of-bounds sequence indexing.
- Errors raise exceptions that can be caught and handled in future language versions (planned).
- Currently, runtime failures halt execution with descriptive error messages.

## 2. Core Runtime Data Types

The runtime provides native support for both classical and biological data types.

| Data Type       | Description                                        |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Integer**     | Standard integer values.                          |
| **Float**       | Floating-point numeric values.                    |
| **Boolean**     | `true` or `false` flags.                          |
| **String**      | Textual data.                                     |
| **DNA Sequence**| Immutable sequences of nucleotides (A, T, C, G).|
| **RNA Sequence**| Sequences with nucleotides (A, U, C, G).         |
| **Protein Seq** | Amino acid sequences representing proteins.      |
| **Genome**      | Composite data structure encapsulating chromosomes, genes, regulatory regions.|
| **Cell**        | Represents biological cells with state, membranes, and contained molecules.|
| **Chemical Env**| Simulated environment representing chemical concentrations and reactions.|

## 3. Execution Model

### 3.1. Parsing and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

- Source code is parsed into an **AST** representing program structure.
- The AST nodes correspond to language constructs: expressions, statements, functions, sequences.

### 3.2. Interpretation and Compilation

HelixLang supports multiple execution modes:

- **Interpreter Mode:**
  - Walks the AST nodes sequentially.
  - Executes operations immediately.
  - Ideal for development and debugging.

- **Intermediate Representation (IR):**
  - The AST is compiled into an IR resembling bytecode or an optimized abstract form.
  - IR is then executed by a virtual machine.
  - Enables performance optimizations and advanced runtime features.

- Future versions plan ahead for **Ahead-of-Time (AOT)** and **Just-in-Time (JIT)** compilation for enhanced performance.

## 4. Biological Simulation Model

### 4.1. Simulation Time Steps

- Biological simulations proceed in discrete time steps (ticks).
- Each tick updates the state of biological entities:
  - Sequence mutations.
  - Protein folding events.
  - Cellular reactions and signaling.

### 4.2. Mutation and Event Handling

- Mutation events are modeled probabilistically or deterministically based on input parameters.
- Simulation hooks allow user-defined callbacks at mutation or reaction events.
- Mutation propagation respects biological constraints (e.g., base pairing rules).

### 4.3. Concurrency and Parallelism

- The runtime supports parallel execution of independent simulation tasks.
- Concurrent simulations can be run to model populations or multiple cells.
- Synchronization primitives ensure consistent state updates.

## 5. Runtime Extensions and Plugins

### 5.1. Plugin Architecture

- The runtime exposes APIs for third-party extensions.
- Plugins can add:
  - New biological data types.
  - Specialized simulation algorithms.
  - Custom analysis or visualization tools.

### 5.2. Integration Points

- Plugins register hooks into the simulation loop.
- Custom operators and functions can be injected at runtime.
- Extensions can access internal symbol tables and runtime state.

## 6. Performance Considerations

- Sequence operations are optimized with lazy evaluation and caching.
- Memory pools reduce overhead for frequent object allocation.
- Parallel simulation support improves throughput on multicore systems.
- Profiling tools are available to identify bottlenecks.

---

## 7. Debugging and Diagnostics

- Runtime provides detailed error messages with stack traces.
- Logging facilities allow tracing execution flow and biological events.
- Planned features:
  - Interactive debugger.
  - Breakpoints on biological events (e.g., mutation).

## 8. Example Runtime Flow

```helixlang
func simulate_gene_mutation(gene dna Seq, steps int) -> dna Seq {
    let mutated = gene
    for i in 0..steps {
        mutated = mutate(mutated)
        if check_error(mutated) {
            return mutated
        }
    }
    return mutated
}

func main() {
    let gene = `ATCGGCTA`
    let result = simulate_gene_mutation(gene, 100)
    print("Mutated gene:", result)
}
